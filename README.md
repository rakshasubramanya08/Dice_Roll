# 🎲 Dice Roll Simulator

This is a simple, interactive dice roll simulator built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The project allows users to "roll" a virtual die and view the outcome instantly with a dynamic dice image. It’s a fun, minimal app to showcase DOM manipulation, event handling, and real-time UI updates.
